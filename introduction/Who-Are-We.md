# Who Are We?
[The Modding Community](https://moddingcommunity.com) (TMC) is a vibrant community geared towards video games, modifications (mods), and open source. Mods, which are created by individuals, companies, or communities outside of the game's original creators, can have a significant impact on gameplay by adding **custom** content to the game such as models, levels/maps, sounds, scripts, and more. However, many mods are designed to support other developers or provide additional functionality for server administrators and other users.
