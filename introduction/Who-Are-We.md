# Who Are We?
[The Modding Community](https://moddingcommunity.com) (TMC) is a vibrant community geared towards video games and content creation. Our goal is to bring together individuals, communities, and companies who support and/or contribute to modding by offering services and tools to help enhance their projects along with a friendly community where you can receive help and advice from.

# What Are Mods?
We encourage and support the use of mods, which are a form of content creation created by individuals, companies, or communities outside of a game's original creators. Mods can and typically do have a significant impact on gameplay by adding **custom** content to a game such as models, levels/maps, sounds, scripts, and more. However, there are also mods that are designed to support other developers or provide additional functionality for server administrators and other users.
